   * **Hints:**  
     * Rom: “Omri and I were just arguing about AI—he always thought he knew better\!”  
     * Rachel: “I heard them yelling in the living room. Rom looked really angry.”

   * **Hints:**

3. **Late Evening: Omri Working Alone in His Room**  
   * **What Happened:** Omri is working on an AI prototype. He messages Michal, asking to meet.  
   * **Hints:**  
     * Michal: “Omri wanted to talk about something important. I didn’t think it was a big deal.”  
     * Rachel: “Omri mentioned he was working late again. Typical.”  
4. **Midnight: Suspicious Sounds Heard**  
   * **What Happened:** A loud noise is heard near Omri’s room. Some characters are awake and notice movement.  
   * **Hints:**  
     * Ilan: “I heard a thud near the study. Thought it was someone moving furniture.”  
     * Neta: “There were footsteps near Omri’s room, but I was too scared to check.”  
   * **Misleading Element:** Rachel mentions: “I saw Rom leaving the hallway around that time. He looked flustered.” This is a red herring—Rom had nothing to do with the murder but was sneaking away to avoid suspicion after an unrelated argument with Omri.

### **Red Herring**

* **Rom’s Flustered Exit:** Multiple characters (Rachel, Ilan) mention seeing Rom in the hallway near Omri’s room. However, Rom was only trying to avoid further arguments with Omri, not committing the murder. This clue distracts players from focusing on Michal.
